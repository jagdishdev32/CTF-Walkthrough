ssh -p 2220 bandit12@bandit.labs.overthewire.org

# Bandit Level 12 → Level 13
Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work using mkdir. For example: mkdir /tmp/myname123. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)

Solution Repeat below commands until decrypt file
'''bash
xxd -r {{filename}}		# Convert dumpfile into file
file {{filename}}		# To check file type	## Most useful
gzip -d {{filename.gz}}	# decrypt gzip file
tar -xf {{file.tar}}	# Decompress tar file
bzip2 -d {{file.bzip2}}	# Decompress bzip2 file
base64 -d {{file}}		# Decompress base64

# Bandit Level 13 → Level 14
Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on

Commands you may need to solve this level
ssh, telnet, nc, openssl, s_client, nmap

The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL encryption.

Helpful note: Getting “HEARTBEATING” and “Read R BLOCK”? Use -ign_eof and read the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage. Next to ‘R’ and ‘Q’, the ‘B’ command also works in this version of that command…

The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which don’t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

The password for the next level is stored in a file readme in the homedirectory. Unfortunately, someone has modified .bashrc to log you out when you log in with SSH.

# Bandit Level 19 → Level 20
Level Goal

To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in the homedirectory. Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level can be found in the usual place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.

solution ./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20

ssh -p 2220 bandit20@bandit.labs.overthewire.org

# Bandit Level 20 → Level 21 (Copied)
Level Goal

There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20). If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).

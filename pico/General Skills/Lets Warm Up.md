## Description

If I told you a word started with 0x70 in hexadecimal, what would it start with in ASCII? 

## Hints

1. Submit your answer in our flag format. For example, if your answer was 'hello', you would submit 'picoCTF{hello}' as the flag.


## Approach

just used python to convert `0x70` into dec which is `112` and then converted dec to char `chr(112)` and it returns `p`

As per hint now flag is `picoCTF{pen}`

## Flag

picoCTF{pen}

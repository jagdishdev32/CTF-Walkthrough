# Scavenger Hunt

## Overview

Points: 50
Category: Web Exploitation

## Description

There is some interesting information hidden around this site http://mercury.picoctf.net:27393/. Can you find it?

## Hints

1. You should have enough hints to find the files, don't run a brute forcer.


## Approach

Just check pages of site

`picoCTF{t`	- index.html

`h4ts_4_l0`	- mycss.css

`t_0f_pl4c` - robots.txt

`3s_2_lO0k` - .htaccess

What stands out the most about that hint is the capitalized "Store". In Macs, a .DS_Store file stores the configurations for how the desktop looks (eg. icon location, etc.) Changing .htacess with .DS_Store got

`_d375c750}` - .DS_Store

## Flag

picoCTF{th4ts_4_l0t_0f_pl4c3s_2_lO0k_d375c750}
